My total number of epochs were 10, for the first epoch it converges really quickly and consistently decreasing the loss on the rest of the epochs. For the batch_size, I notice 32, 64, 128 and 256 are optimal in training neural nets so I decided to opt for batch_size = 64 as it would not be too huge for the network to train and training at a consistent rate.\n",

Furthermore n_layers = 2, in RNN the more layers it is it would not really affect the network perfomances. As far as number of layers is concern 3 layers outperforms 2 but going deeper rarely helps more and the more layers will also result the network to overfit. \n"
